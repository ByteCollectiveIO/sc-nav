# Feature backlog

The working list of what's **next, small, or parked** — not a history book.
Consolidated 2026-07-04 (as of **v0.36.0**): shipped features are one line in
the [Shipped log](#shipped-log) with a pointer to their spec doc; the full
historical design prose that used to live here is preserved verbatim in
[`archive/feature-backlog-full-2026-07-04.md`](archive/feature-backlog-full-2026-07-04.md).

**How this file works**
- Numbering continues from the historical backlog (#1–25); new items start at #26.
- An active entry captures *decisions*, so it can be picked up without re-deriving.
- When something ships it collapses to a Shipped-log row; its spec doc (if any)
  is the lasting reference. Doc statuses live in [`docs/README.md`](README.md).

## Now / next

### 26. SC Wiki API reference-data layer 🆕 (foundation — do first)

**Status:** researched + probed live 2026-07-04, not built.

`https://api.star-citizen.wiki` (OpenAPI at `/api/openapi`) is a public,
game-version-scoped JSON API — no auth for game data, pagination
`page[size]` ≤ 200, license **CC BY-SA 4.0 with attribution** (unlike erkul's
CC BY-NC-ND, which we rejected). Use **English fields only** (German strings are
BY-NC-SA). It resolves the project's two standing data blockers and opens three
enrichment paths (#27, #25, #28).

**Deliverable:** a sync/distill script (same convention as
[`quantum-data-pipeline.md`](quantum-data-pipeline.md): fetch → distill →
committed `poi/*.json`, **no live runtime calls**), each output stamped with the
game version from `GET /api/game-versions/default` (currently
`4.8.2-LIVE.12030094`). Add a one-line attribution ("Game data:
Star Citizen Wiki, CC BY-SA 4.0") to the site footer/about. Manual per-patch
re-run is the cadence; runtime auto-refresh is deliberately not v1.

Key endpoints (all probed): `/api/vehicles` (290 ships, incl. per-ship `quantum`
block + `fuel` + `cargo_grids` + `insurance` + `uex_prices`),
`/api/vehicle-items?filter[type]=QuantumDrive` (full drive stats),
`/api/blueprints` (1,559 recipes w/ ingredients, craft time, dismantle returns),
`/api/locations/positions?filter[system]=` (x/y/z + `qt_valid` + parent, 809
Stanton entities), `/api/locations/{id}` (per-POI `quantum_travel` radii +
`amenities`), `/api/commodities` (box sizes, mineable/harvestable/salvage flags).

### 27. Quantum fuel & max jump-range (cargo + trade planners)

**Status:** designed (docs complete), **UNBLOCKED 2026-07-04** by #26.
Spec: [`quantum-fuel-range.md`](quantum-fuel-range.md) +
[`quantum-data-pipeline.md`](quantum-data-pipeline.md).

Decisions locked: default drive + override picker; max-range as **advisory
warning** with an opt-in "only in-range routes" hard constraint; unmatched ships
degrade gracefully (no fabricated numbers). The original blocker — an early
datamined pass covered only ~49% of hauler ships (that raw mine has since been
removed) — is solved: source the per-ship `quantum` block from `/api/vehicles`
(**95% coverage**, 230/242 spaceships; the 12 missing are drive-less snubs,
correctly absent) and the drive catalog from
`/api/vehicle-items?filter[type]=QuantumDrive`. The SCU/Gm fuel math and JSON
shapes from the design carry over unchanged; only the source is the wiki API.

### 25. Blueprint craft commissions (marketplace mode #4)

**Status:** designed 2026-07-04, not built.
Spec: [`blueprint-craft-commissions.md`](blueprint-craft-commissions.md).

"Build me this item, to this spec, for this price" as a fourth listing mode
reusing the listings/offers/dual-confirm machinery wholesale. The blueprint
reference feed comes from `/api/blueprints` via #26 (decision already locked in
the spec; the local mine is the cross-check). v1 = mode + feed + spec-builder +
Discord ping; v1.1 = member blueprint library ("requests I can craft").

### 28. Starmap & POI enrichment from the wiki API 🆕 (needs scoping)

**Status:** opportunity identified 2026-07-04; three independent slices, each
cheap once #26 exists. Scope before building.

- **a) POI validation/expansion** — `/api/locations/positions` gives real x/y/z
  + `qt_valid` + parent hierarchy per system (stanton/pyro/nyx). Cross-check our
  starmap.space-derived POI set; backfill missing QT destinations.
- **b) Arrival & detour radii** — per-POI `quantum_travel`
  (`arrival_radius`/`obstruction_radius`, e.g. Everus Harbor 24 km/8 km) can
  sharpen run-mode arrival detection and replace the flat org-wide
  `hazard_radius_km` detour margin with per-destination values.
- **c) Terminal amenities** — `amenities` (Commodity Trading via freight
  elevator vs. loading dock, hangar/pad sizes, clinics) → trade-planner stop
  annotations and pad-size-vs-ship warnings.

## Fast-follows by app

Small, unblocked items harvested (2026-07-04) from every spec doc's
Deferred/Open sections, so they stop hiding in eighteen files. Grab
opportunistically; none is urgent.

- **Trade planner (#21):** teammate-lane-awareness ("someone's already running
  this lane" — needs a presence-side design pass first) · exact B&B "thorough"
  solver option under a ≤4-stop cap.
- **Danger board / routing (#24):** two-waypoint detour fallback (v2.1 — a
  `# v2.1` marker sits at the spot in `nav_core`) · severity-scale + radius
  tuning once the board has real data (partly superseded by #28b).
- **Marketplace (#15):** inventory bridge (list from holdings; one-click list
  surplus from met goals) · price history → "fair price" hint from completed
  deals · WTB saved searches (largely realized by #25) · richer reputation
  (only if abuse appears).
- **Resource Manager (#14):** map→goal badging ("needed for N goals" in the
  finder) · contribution history/leaderboard · goal templates (ship BOMs) ·
  goal-met → marketplace bridge.
- **Events (#13/#20):** POI-linked event location (autocomplete exists; still
  stores freeform text) · recurring events via a "clone event" shortcut ·
  attendance / organizer leaderboard · per-user timezone setting ·
  edit/start-time-change notifications.
- **Cargo planner (#12):** start-from-chosen-POI (`start_id`) + free start ·
  contract-selection advisor (reward-per-hour is already captured) · per-leg
  drive-accurate ETA (lands with #27).
- **Identity (#17):** member-facing directory surface (opt-out already honored)
  · directory avatars (hash captured; rendering is one CDN call).
- **Notifications (#18):** auction "ending soon" ping (needs a scheduled loop) ·
  goal milestone pings at 50/75% (off by default).
- **Platform:** capture-side Discord-id attribution (`owner_id` still =
  `player_id` on capture; deletes are already discord-scoped — the last
  migration tail) · cosmetic handle editing via `PUT /api/me`.

---

## Parked (deliberate, with reasons)

- **#22 Refinery job tracker** — real SC pain point but per-player utility, not
  org-oriented.
- **#23 Recognition badges** — liked, but can get tacky fast; revisit with
  restraint (few, earned, tasteful).
- **OCR contract ingestion (#12)** — the only remaining cargo-entry automation;
  brittle across game UI patches, a project in its own right.
- **3D box bin-packing (#12/#21)** — scalar "usable SCU" is good enough.
- **Watcher packaging (.exe)** — stay a Python script until adoption feedback
  says otherwise; PyInstaller + code-signing (~$200/yr) is the plan if revisited.
- **Monetization / CIG permission inquiry** —
  [`monetization-and-deployment.md`](monetization-and-deployment.md); draft the
  CIG ask only if a paid hosting tier becomes real. Non-commercial rule stands.
- **Discord DMs / bot** — webhook-only stands; revisit only if members ask for
  private alerts.
- **Redis / multi-worker** — won't-do at org size; the in-process hub requires a
  single worker (documented loudly in the migration doc).
